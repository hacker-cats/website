# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This appears to be a newly initialized repository with minimal structure:
- Contains only an empty `website/` directory
- No package.json, build files, or source code present yet
- No existing development workflow or commands available

## Development Environment

Since this is an empty repository, typical development commands are not yet established. When files are added, check for:
- Package managers (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, etc.) and their associated commands
- Build tools and configuration files
- Testing frameworks and scripts
- Linting and formatting tools

## Next Steps

This repository appears to be in its initial state. Future development will likely involve:
1. Setting up the project structure in the `website/` directory
2. Adding package management and build configuration
3. Establishing development workflows and scripts

Update this CLAUDE.md file as the project structure and tooling evolves.
